# Damped_Oscillator_Simulation
This repository contains a Python script that uses the Duhamel integral to calculate the displacement and velocity of a damped harmonic oscillator subjected to an external force. The script allows the user to input system parameters and then computes the response of the system over a specified simulation time.
